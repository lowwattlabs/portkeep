# PortKeep — Feature Specification

Self-hosted, bare-metal-first port management + security tool. One binary, one config, zero cloud dependency.

---

## CLI Design Principles

- Single binary (Go or Rust), no runtime deps, no Docker required
- `portkeep <command>` — verb-noun pattern, discoverable
- `--json` flag on every command for scripting/piping
- `--quiet` for cron/automation use
- Color output by default, `--no-color` for pipes
- Tab completion for bash/zsh/fish
- Help text fits in one screen. Examples in every `--help`.

## Core Commands

### Discovery & Inventory

- [ ] `portkeep scan` — scan all listening ports on this host (ss/netstat wrapper)
  - [ ] `--node <name>` — scan a remote node via SSH (key-only, no password)
  - [ ] `--all` — scan all registered nodes
  - [ ] `--docker` — include Docker container port mappings
  - [ ] `--format table|json|markdown` — output format
  - [ ] `--watch` — continuous scan, alert on changes (like `watch` but smart)

- [ ] `portkeep ports list` — list all known ports from registry
  - [ ] `--node <name>` filter by node
  - [ ] `--state open|closed|declared|rogue` filter by state
  - [ ] `--bind loopback|lan|wan|wildcard` filter by bind address scope
  - [ ] `--service <name>` filter by service name
  - [ ] `--sort port|service|bind|risk` sort options

- [ ] `portkeep ports show <port>` — detail view for one port
  - [ ] Process name, PID, binary path, systemd unit
  - [ ] Bind address + scope (loopback/LAN/WAN/wildcard)
  - [ ] Declared service (if any) vs actual
  - [ ] Security score + risk flags
  - [ ] Firewall rule status
  - [ ] First seen / last seen timestamps
  - [ ] Change history (last 10 events)

### Registry & Port Claims

- [ ] `portkeep claim <port> --service <name> --note <desc>` — register a port
  - [ ] `--bind <addr>` — declare intended bind address
  - [ ] `--range system|reserved|dashboard|dev|ephemeral` — category
  - [ ] `--owner <name>` — who/what owns this port
  - [ ] Rejects if port already claimed (override with `--force`, logs conflict)

- [ ] `portkeep unclaim <port>` — remove a claim from registry

- [ ] `portkeep claim next [--range <range>]` — suggest next available port in range
  - [ ] Respects range conventions (1-1023 system, 1024-4999 reserved, 5000-9999 dashboards, 10000+ ephemeral)
  - [ ] Ranges configurable in config.yaml

- [ ] `portkeep claim import` — bulk import from JSON/CSV

- [ ] `portkeep claim export` — export registry as JSON/CSV/Markdown

### Drift Detection

- [ ] `portkeep drift` — compare declared registry vs actual listening ports
  - [ ] `--node <name>` per-node check
  - [ ] `--all` all nodes
  - [ ] Reports:
    - Rogue ports: listening but not declared
    - Ghost ports: declared but not listening
    - Bind mismatch: declared loopback, actually 0.0.0.0
    - Service mismatch: declared as X, process is Y
  - [ ] Exit code: 0 = clean, 1 = drift found (useful for CI/cron)

- [ ] `portkeep drift watch` — continuous drift monitoring
  - [ ] `--interval <seconds>` (default 60)
  - [ ] `--alert` — push alert on any drift event

### Security & Scoring

- [ ] `portkeep audit` — full security audit
  - [ ] Per-port risk flags:
    - 🟢 Loopback only (127.0.0.1, ::1) — safe
    - 🟡 LAN-only (192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x) — moderate
    - 🔴 WAN/Tailscale reachable — needs review
    - ⛔ Wildcard (0.0.0.0, ::, *) — dangerous without firewall
  - [ ] Overall exposure score: 0-100 (lower = safer)
    - Weighted by bind scope + port sensitivity (SSH/DB higher weight than random dev port)
  - [ ] Summary: "6 loopback, 3 LAN, 2 WAN, 1 wildcard"
  - [ ] `--json` for machine consumption
  - [ ] `--fix` — suggest concrete remediations for each flag

- [ ] `portkeep firewall check` — cross-reference ports against firewall rules
  - [ ] Supports: UFW, iptables, nftables, firewalld
  - [ ] Reports:
    - Open port with no allow rule (blocked by default? or firewall gap?)
    - Allow rule for port that isn't listening (stale rule)
    - Allow rule too permissive (allows from 0.0.0.0 for a loopback-only service)
  - [ ] `--diff` — firewall rules changed since last check

- [ ] `portkeep cve <port>` — check known CVEs for the service on that port
  - [ ] Service fingerprinting via nmap -sV or banner grab
  - [ ] Local NVD cache (downloaded weekly, ~200MB)
  - [ ] `--refresh` — update NVD cache
  - [ ] `--all` — CVE check every listening service

- [ ] `portkeep shodan` — check if any of your ports appear on Shodan
  - [ ] Requires `SHODAN_API_KEY` (free tier = 100 searches/mo)
  - [ ] Checks each WAN-facing IP/port combo
  - [ ] `--cache` — cache results for 24h (don't burn API quota)

### Service Fingerprinting

- [ ] `portkeep fingerprint <port>` — identify what's actually running
  - [ ] Banner grab (TCP connect, read first bytes)
  - [ ] nmap -sV integration (if nmap available, else graceful fallback)
  - [ ] TLS cert extraction (issuer, expiry, SANs)
  - [ ] HTTP header probe for web services
  - [ ] Stores fingerprint in registry for drift comparison

### Network Segment Awareness

- [ ] `portkeep network map` — show which ports are reachable from which segments
  - [ ] Segments auto-detected: loopback, LAN, Tailscale, Docker bridge, custom VLANs
  - [ ] Configurable in config.yaml (define subnets + names)
  - [ ] "Pi-hole DNS :53 is reachable from IoT subnet — flag?"
  - [ ] `--add-segment <name> <cidr>` — define a custom segment
  - [ ] `--remove-segment <name>` — remove a segment

### History & Timeline

- [ ] `portkeep history` — git-log style change timeline
  - [ ] `--port <n>` — filter by port
  - [ ] `--node <name>` — filter by node
  - [ ] `--since <time>` — "since yesterday", "since 2026-06-01"
  - [ ] `--type appear|disappear|bind-change|process-change|claim|unclaim` — event types
  - [ ] Output: "Jun 3 14:22 port 3200 appeared (python3, PID 1518) — NOT DECLARED"

- [ ] `portkeep history diff` — compare two snapshots
  - [ ] `--from <time> --to <time>` — time range
  - [ ] Shows added/removed/changed ports between snapshots

- [ ] `portkeep snapshot` — save current state as a named checkpoint
  - [ ] `--name <label>` — "pre-deploy", "after-restart", etc.
  - [ ] `portkeep snapshot list` — show all saved snapshots
  - [ ] `portkeep snapshot restore <name>` — compare current vs that snapshot

### Alerting

- [ ] `portkeep alert config` — set up alert destinations
  - [ ] Webhook (generic HTTP POST)
  - [ ] Telegram (chat ID + bot token)
  - [ ] Email (SMTP)
  - [ ] Local script execution
  - [ ] `--test` — send test alert

- [ ] `portkeep alert rules list` — show active alert rules
  - [ ] `portkeep alert rules add` — create a rule
    - [ ] `--on appear|disappear|drift|bind-change|rogue|score-change`
    - [ ] `--port <n>` or `--any-port` (any port matching condition)
    - [ ] `--threshold <n>` — for score-change: alert if exposure score exceeds N
    - [ ] `--destination <name>` — which alert destination to use
  - [ ] `portkeep alert rules remove <id>` — delete a rule

- [ ] Built-in smart alerts (enabled by default, configurable):
  - [ ] New port appeared that isn't declared → alert
  - [ ] Port bind changed from loopback to wider scope → alert
  - [ ] Exposure score increased → alert
  - [ ] Service on well-known port changed process → alert

### Compliance Templates

- [ ] `portkeep compliance list` — available policy templates
  - [ ] CIS Benchmark Level 1 (Linux)
  - [ ] CISA SMB Baseline
  - [ ] Custom (user-defined YAML policies)

- [ ] `portkeep compliance check <template>` — audit against a policy
  - [ ] Returns pass/fail per check with remediation
  - [ ] `--json` for CI integration

- [ ] `portkeep compliance template create <name>` — create custom policy
  - [ ] YAML format: rules like "no wildcard bind on ports < 1024", "SSH must be key-only", etc.

### Multi-Node Management

- [ ] `portkeep node add <name> --host <addr> --ssh-key <path>` — register a node
  - [ ] SSH key-only auth, no passwords
  - [ ] Stores node config in config.yaml
  - [ ] `--labels <k=v,...>` — tag nodes (prod, dev, etc.)
